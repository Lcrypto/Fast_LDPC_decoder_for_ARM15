As promised in our article (High-Throughput LDPC Decoder on Low-Power Embedded Processors, DOI:
10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2477081) we published the LDPC decoder source codes. Thus, performances can
be replayed and work better understood. 

> Please make the same !

In order to compile one LDPC decoder, just move to bin folder and type:

> make

to build the default LDPC decoder. Then play with it (please have a look to : https://github.com/blegal/Fast_LDPC_decoder_for_x86/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

> build.py

To generate the 140 decidated LDPC decoders, just lauch the build.py script.
